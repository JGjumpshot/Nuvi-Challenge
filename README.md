# Nuvi-Challenge
Walk through of social media users displaying social media platform, likes, shares and comments and other social media information

Starting from the landing page we are able to walk through and click either the 'Get Started' button, 'See Users' button 
or the users tab on the nav bar. As you navigate to the users state you will see users and 4 pieces of meta data: username, profile pic,
social media platform and the date the activity was published. Click on the name and you will see it highlight and go to the profile state.
On the profile state you will see the activities, messages, pictures etc. displayed with that specific user. 

Just a heads up the about and read more about us functions are there for show only.
